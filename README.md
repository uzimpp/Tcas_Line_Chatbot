# To be honest
I used ChatGPT to fix most of the problems which I have found since I started this porject from literally 0 to be able to finish this chatbot.
I have learned so many many things such as planning a bot. For example , planning which functions should be in the chatbot or which isn't. This is able to guide me how to code quite a lot.
